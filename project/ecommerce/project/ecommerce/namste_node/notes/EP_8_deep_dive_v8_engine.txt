Steps V8 engine does when do is Executed
______________________________________

A. PARSING
    1. Lexical Analysis ( also known as tokanization) - code is broken in to tokens
    2. syntax Analysis ( also known as parsing) - Token is converted to AST ( Abstract Syntax tree)
        - https://astexplorer.net/ ( visit site for AST tree view)
    3. AST is forworded to INTERPRETTER 
            There aare 2 types language
                a. Interpreted language 
                    --> It reads the code line by line
                    --> Fast initial execution
                    --> Interpreter interprites the language and goes line by line
                    
                b.Compiled 
                    --> First High level code is conveted to machine code
                    --> Initially Heavy but executed fast
                    --> compilter compiles the code
                

    ### IMPORTANT - Java script uses both Interpreter and compilter to execute code it has JIT ( Just in time) compilter

->  AST is passed to interpreter . ( Google v8engine has a Interpreter named IGNITION Interpreter) 
-> Job of IGNITION Interpreter is to convert in to byte code and then byte code is executed.
-> TORBO FAN compiler is present in google v8engine -> work is -> when IGNITION In recevies ASt is finds the code/variable/function which is used multipletimes it gives to TORBO FAN for faster execution when ran multiple times.
-> TORBO FAN converts it in to OPTIMIZED MACHINE CODE AND THEN EXECUTED. 
->  TORBO FAN  also de optimized code when required . below is the example when required
 let say you have a sum sunction sum(n1,n2) . 
        sum(10,5) -> TORBO FAN optimized the function asumming always number will come as params .
        sum(15,25) -> executes very fast on next call as it is a number
        sum("a","b") -> TORBO FAN de optimize the code as params is non numeric and process is slow

            TORBO FAN compiler   ⟹ ⟹ OPTIMIZED/                    ⇑
                ↓                   DEOPTIMIZED MACHINE CODE         ⇑
                ↓                        ( and send back to          ⇑
                ↓                        IGNITION INTERPRETTER  )    ⇑
                ↓                                                    ⇑
                ↓                                                    ⇑
                ↓                                                    ⇑                                                     
        OPTIMIZED MACHINE CODE  ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹ ⟹  ⇑

Garbage Collection
______________________________________
It is a parallel Collection. It happens simoltatiously.
-> ORICONO and OIL PAN,  Scavenger, Scavenger is the Name of Garbage collector in V8 engine
-> Inline caching
-> Earlier crank shaft compiler
-> Java script is intime complie language
