TIMMER ==>  PENDING CALLBACKS ==> IDLE,PREPARE ==> POLL ==> CHECK ==>CLOSE (its a circular loop)

TICK ==> The complete cycle is called one TICK
PENDING CALLBACKS -> Executes I/O call backs diffred to next ittration (TICK)
IDLE,PREPARE -> only used internally

As inside node js libuv runs there is another diagram of event loop

THREAD POOL
___________________
when we are making a file system (read a file) call / cryto => it goes to event loop => then goes to thread pool 
                                                    => Then  it request the  OS then the file is read
                                                    => returns back to thread pool ( the particular thread is blocked)

==> UV_THREAD_POLL_SIZE = 4 ( By default)

Q> WHAT WILL HAPEN WHEN 5 FS CALL MADE SYMOLTANIOUSLY ? COZ UV_THREAD_POLL_SIZE is 4?
===================================================================================
ANS > it will wait for one thread to be empty


=> fs - dns.lookup - crypto
      - user specified input

Q> is node js single thraded or multi thread ?
===================================================================================
ANS > when we run syncronous code then node js is single threaded.
    when we we are readong a life which require libuv and thread poll it is a multi threaded (when file read operation) .

    When we run synchronous code, Node.js is single-threaded because the main
    JavaScript thread executes the code and blocks the event loop.

    When we perform operations like file reading, Node.js uses libuv and its
    thread pool, making it multi-threaded internally.
