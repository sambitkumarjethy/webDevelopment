-> Enent-driven architecture and capable of async I/O  

JS -> syncronous single threaded language
-> Js is single threaded -> line by line execution
-> to do multiple operation -
-> syncronous vs async flow
-> async no blocking and sync is blocking IO
-> node does Async opertation using super power.


# V8 engine in js ( call stack,memory heap, Garbage collector)
-> JS code exicute code in mili seconds
-> to execute file,db,www(http), timmer  you need super power comes from node
-> settimeout is used to make wait js to execute code 
-> Js doesnot have concept of timer
-> The super power comes from node which is LIBuv (SUPER HERO).
-> v8 engine ofloads async task to LIBuv

flow
v8 engine -> libuv ->OS 
=> Node js is combination of V8 and libuv

=> using libuv async IO made simple
=> libuv is writen in C language
=> libuv manages thread poll, event loop, IO call back, set timmer ,file  sysytem.

How code flows in JS v8 engine
===================================
=> when a code is executed it goes to call stack and creates global execution context
=> When GEC  ( Global execution context )  gets a API call .. GEC calls libuv as ask to manage it and get the response
=>  When GEC gets a Timmer (setTtimeout) .. GEC calls libuv as ask to manage it and get the response
=> When GEC gets a File .. GEC calls libuv as ask to manage it and get the response
=> When GEC gets a function  .. It manages itself
=> When FEC ( functional execution context ) gets a function call  .. It manages itself


======> nodejs can do asyncronous IO ( Input Output) . It is also called non blocking IO using V* engine.
=> v8 engine call stack is a single thread
