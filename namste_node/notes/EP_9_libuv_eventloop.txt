==> Lib uv consist of 
    1. Event loop
    2. callback Ques
    3. THREAD POOL


==> JAVASCRIPT is single threaded synchronous language
---> when v8 engine is busy then the lib uv maintain callback ques and then send to v8 engine call stack
===> The main task of Libuv is Asyncronous I/O (Non blocking I/O) 


WHEN TASK IS LOADED TO LIBUV . WHAT HAPPENS next?
__________________________________________________

-> When the async ask of lib uv is over then it maintains a call stack and when the syncrorous task of v8 engine is over(i.e call stack of v8 engine is over) then LIBUV call stack is executed.

Eventloop -> Jib is to keep checking callback ques and call stack when call stack is empty it will give it to v8 engine call stack
 -> IMP - . Its Job is to push the event in to v8 call stack in correct order and correct time prioritizing the task.


 EVENTLOOP 
 ===============

 TIMMER ==> POLL ==> CHECK ==>CLOSE (its a circular loop)

4 Major Phase
_______________
 1. Timmer Phase -> setTimeout (operations is performed)
 2. Poll Phase  -> I/O callback, incomming connections, hhtp call,  data,fs,crypto,http.get (operations is performed)
 3. check Phase -> setImmediate  (operations is performed)
 4. close -> All close operation is performed (ex- socket.on(close))
