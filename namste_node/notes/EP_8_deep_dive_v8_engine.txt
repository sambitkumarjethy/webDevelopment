A. PARSING
    1. Lexical Analysis ( also known as tokanization) - code is broken in to tokens
    2. syntax Analysis ( also known as parsing) - Token is converted to AST ( Abstract Syntax tree)
        - https://astexplorer.net/ ( visit site for AST tree view)
    3. AST is forworded to INTERPRETTER 
            There aare 2 types language
                a. Interpreted language 
                    --> It reads the code line by line
                    --> Fast initial execution
                    --> Interpreter interprites the language and goes line by line
                    
                b.Compiled 
                    --> First High level code is conveted to machine code
                    --> Initially Heavy but executed fast
                    --> compilter compiles the code
                

    ### IMPORTANT - Java script uses both Interpreter and compilter to execute code it has JIT ( Just in time) compilter
